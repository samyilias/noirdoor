# Backend is using Hapi
# The front end is linked to the backend using a proxy 

I did use firebase to host my images and audio files , but unfortunatly I was not able to fetch the data from the firebase cloud storage . I did hardcode the urls and sent them as an object for /users/john route.

## start the server
    cd noirdoor/ nodemon
